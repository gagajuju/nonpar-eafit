# Installation of `R` and `RStudio` {#app-install}

This is what you have to do in order to install `R` and `RStudio` in your own computer:

1. In Mac OS X, download and install first [`XQuartz`](https://www.xquartz.org/) and log out and back on your Mac OS X account (this is an **important** step that is required for 3D graphics to work). Be sure that your Mac OS X system is up-to-date.
2. Download the latest version of `R` at <https://cran.r-project.org/>. For Windows, you can download it directly [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.html). For Mac OS X you can download the latest version (at the time of writing this, `3.4.1`) [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.4.1.pkg).
3. Install `R`. In Windows, be sure to select the `'Startup options'` and then choose `'SDI'` in the `'Display Mode'` options. Leave the rest of installation options as default.
4. Download the latest version of `RStudio` for your system at <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> and install it.

If there is any Linux user, kindly follow the corresponding instructions [here](https://cran.r-project.org/) for installing `R`,  [download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) `RStudio` (only certain `Ubuntu` and `Fedora` versions are supported), and install it using your package manager.

# Introduction to `RStudio` {#app-introRStudio}

`RStudio` is the most employed Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for `R` nowadays. When you start `RStudio` you will see a window similar to Figure \@ref(fig:rstudio). There are a lot of items in the GUI, most of them described in the [`RStudio` IDE Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf). The most important things to keep in mind are:

1. The code is written in scripts in the *source panel* (upper-right panel in Figure \@ref(fig:rstudio));
2. for running a line or code selection from the script in the *console* (first tab in the lower-right panel in Figure \@ref(fig:rstudio)), you do it with the keyboard shortcut `'Ctrl+Enter'` (Windows and Linux) or `'Cmd+Enter'` (Mac OS X).

```{r, rstudio, echo = FALSE, fig.pos = 'h!', out.width = '70%', fig.cap = 'Main window of `RStudio`. The red shows the code panel and the yellow shows the console output. Extracted from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf).', cache = TRUE}

# Introduction to `R` {#app-introR}

This section provides a collection of self-explainable snippets of the programming language `R` [@R-base] that show the very basics of the language. It is not meant to be an exhaustive introduction to `R`, but rather a reminder/panoramic of a collection of basic functions and methods.

In the following, `#` denotes comments to the code and `##` outputs of the code.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
rm(list = ls())
```

#### Simple computations {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# The console can act as a simple calculator
1.0 + 1.1
2 * 2
3/2
2^3
1/0
0/0

# Use ";" for performing several operations in the same line
(1 + 3) * 2 - 1; 3 + 2

# Elemental mathematical functions
sqrt(2); 2^0.5
exp(1)
log(10) # Neperian logarithm
log10(10); log2(10) # Logs in base 10 and 2
sin(pi); cos(0); asin(0)
tan(pi/3)
sqrt(-1)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Remember to close the parenthesis
1 +
(1 + 3
```

```{exercise}
Compute:

- $\frac{e^{2}+\sin(2)}{\cos^{-1}\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)+2}$. *Answer*: `2.723274`.
- $\sqrt{3^{2.5}+\log(10)}$. *Answer*: `4.22978`.
- $(2^{0.93}-\log_2(3 + \sqrt{2+\sin(1)}))10^{\tan(1/3))}\sqrt{3^{2.5}+\log(10)}$. *Answer*: `-3.032108`.

```

#### Variables and assignment {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# Any operation that you perform in R can be stored in a variable (or object)
# with the assignment operator "<-"
x <- 1

# To see the value of a variable, simply type it
x

# A variable can be overwritten
x <- 1 + 1

# Now the value of x is 2 and not 1, as before
x

# Careful with capitalization
X

# Different
X <- 3
x; X

# The variables are stored in your workspace (a .RData file)
# A handy tip to see what variables are in the workspace
ls()
# Now you know which variables can be accessed!

# Remove variables
rm(X)
X
```

```{exercise}
Do the following:

- Store $-123$ in the variable `y`.
- Store the log of the square of `y` in `z`.
- Store $\frac{y-z}{y+z^2}$ in `y` and remove `z`.
- Output the value of `y`. *Answer*: `4.366734`.

```

#### Vectors {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, error = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# These are vectors - arrays of numbers
# We combine numbers with the function "c"
c(1, 3)
c(1.5, 0, 5, -3.4)

# A handy way of creating integer sequences is the operator ":"
# Sequence from 1 to 5
1:5

# Storing some vectors
myData <- c(1, 2)
myData2 <- c(-4.12, 0, 1.1, 1, 3, 4)
myData
myData2

# Entrywise operations
myData + 1
myData^2

# If you want to access a position of a vector, use [position]
myData[1]
myData2[6]

# You also can change elements
myData[1] <- 0
myData

# Think on what you want to access...
myData2[7]
myData2[0]

# If you want to access all the elements except a position, use [-position]
myData2[-1]
myData2[-2]

# Also with vectors as indexes
myData2[1:2]
myData2[myData]

# And also
myData2[-c(1, 2)]

# But do not mix positive and negative indexes!
myData2[c(-1, 2)]

# Remove the first element
myData2 <- myData2[-1]
```

```{exercise}
Do the following:

- Create the vector $x=(1, 7, 3, 4)$.
- Create the vector $y=(100, 99, 98, ..., 2, 1)$.
- Create the vector $z=c(4, 8, 16, 32, 96)$.
- Compute $x_2+y_4$ and $\cos(x_3) + \sin(x_2) e^{-y_2}$. *Answers*: `104` and `-0.9899925`.
- Set $x_{2}=0$ and $y_{2}=-1$. Recompute the previous expressions. *Answers*: `97` and `2.785875`.
- Index $y$ by $x+1$ and store it as `z`. What is the output? *Answer*: `z` is `c(-1, 100, 97, 96)`.

```

#### Some functions {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, error = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# Functions take arguments between parenthesis and transform them into an output
sum(myData)
prod(myData)

# Summary of an object
summary(myData)

# Length of the vector
length(myData)

# Mean, standard deviation, variance, covariance, correlation
mean(myData)
var(myData)
cov(myData, myData^2)
cor(myData, myData * 2)
quantile(myData)

# Maximum and minimum of vectors
min(myData)
which.min(myData)

# Usually the functions have several arguments, which are set by "argument = value"
# In this case, the second argument is a logical flag to indicate the kind of sorting
sort(myData) # If nothing is specified, decreasing = FALSE is assumed
sort(myData, decreasing = TRUE)

# Do not know what are the arguments of a function? Use args and help!
args(mean)
?mean
```

```{exercise}
Do the following:

- Compute the mean, median and variance of $y$. *Answers*: `49.5`, `49.5`, `843.6869`.
- Do the same for $y+1$. What are the differences?
- What is the maximum of $y$? Where is it placed?
- Sort $y$ increasingly and obtain the 5th and 76th positions. *Answer*: `c(4,75)`.
- Compute the covariance between $y$ and $y$. Compute the variance of $y$. Why do you get the same result?

```

#### Matrices, data frames, and lists {-}

```{r, collapse = TRUE, error = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# A matrix is an array of vectors
A <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
A

# Another matrix
B <- matrix(1, nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
B

# Matrix is a vector with dimension attributes
dim(A)

# Binding by rows or columns
rbind(1:3, 4:6)
cbind(1:3, 4:6)

# Entrywise operations
A + 1
A * B

# Accessing elements
A[2, 1] # Element (2, 1)
A[1, ] # First row - this is a vector
A[, 2] # First column - this is a vector

# Obtain rows and columns as matrices (and not as vectors)
A[1, , drop = FALSE]
A[, 2, drop = FALSE]

# Matrix transpose
t(A)

# Matrix multiplication
A %*% B
A %*% B[, 1]
A %*% B[1, ]

# Care is needed
A %*% B[1, , drop = FALSE] # Incompatible product

# Compute inverses with "solve"
solve(A) %*% A

# A data frame is a matrix with column names
# Useful when you have multiple variables
myDf <- data.frame(var1 = 1:2, var2 = 3:4)
myDf

# You can change names
names(myDf) <- c("newname1", "newname2")
myDf

# The nice thing is that you can access variables by its name with
# the "$" operator
myDf$newname1

# And create new variables also (it has to be of the same
# length as the rest of variables)
myDf$myNewVariable <- c(0, 1)
myDf

# A list is a collection of arbitrary variables
myList <- list(myData = myData, A = A, myDf = myDf)

# Access elements by names
myList$myData
myList$A
myList$myDf

# Reveal the structure of an object
str(myList)
str(myDf)

# A less lengthy output
names(myList)
```

```{exercise}
Do the following:

- Create a matrix called `M` with rows given by `y[3:5]`, `y[3:5]^2` and `log(y[3:5])`.
- Create a data frame called `myDataFrame` with column names "y", "y2" and "logy" containing the vectors `y[3:5]`, `y[3:5]^2` and `log(y[3:5])`, respectively.
- Create a list, called `l`, with entries for `x` and `M`. Access the elements by their names.
- Compute the squares of `myDataFrame` and save the result as `myDataFrame2`.
- Compute the log of the sum of `myDataFrame` and `myDataFrame2`. *Answer*:

          ##         y       y2     logy
          ## 1 9.180087 18.33997 3.242862
          ## 2 9.159678 18.29895 3.238784
          ## 3 9.139059 18.25750 3.234656

```

#### More on data frames {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, error = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# Let's begin importing the iris dataset
data(iris)

# "names" gives you the variables in the data frame
names(iris)

# The beginning of the data
head(iris)

# So we can access variables by "$" or as in a matrix
iris$Sepal.Length[1:10]
iris[1:10, 1]
iris[3, 1]

# Information on the dimension of the data frame
dim(iris)

# "str" gives the structure of any object in R
str(iris)

# Recall the species variable: it is a categorical variable (or factor),
# not a numeric variable
iris$Species[1:10]

# Factors can only take certain values
levels(iris$Species)

# If a file contains a variable with character strings as observations (either
# encapsulated by quotation marks or not), the variable will become a factor
# when imported into R
```

```{exercise}
Do the following:

- Load the `faithful` dataset into `R`.
- Get the dimensions of `faithful` and show beginning of the data.
- Retrieve the fifth observation of `eruptions` in two different ways.
- Obtain a summary of `waiting`.

```

#### Vector-related functions {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, error = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# The function "seq" creates sequences of numbers equally separated
seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)
seq(0, 1, length.out = 5)

# You can short the latter argument
seq(0, 1, l = 5)

# Repeat number
rep(0, 5)

# Reverse a vector
myVec <- c(1:5, -1:3)
rev(myVec)

# Another way
myVec[length(myVec):1]

# Count repetitions in your data
table(iris$Sepal.Length)
table(iris$Species)
```

```{exercise}
Do the following:

- Create the vector $x=(0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2)$.
- Create a vector of length 100 ranging from $0$ to $1$ with entries equally separated.
- Compute the amount of zeros and ones in `x <- c(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)`. Check that they are the same as in `rev(x)`.
- Compute the vector $(0.1, 1.1, 2.1, ..., 100.1)$ in four different ways using `seq` and `rev`. Do the same but using `:` instead of `seq`. (*Hint*: add `0.1`)

```

#### Logical conditions and subsetting {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, error = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# Relational operators: x < y, x > y, x <= y, x >= y, x == y, x!= y
# They return TRUE or FALSE

# Smaller than
0 < 1

# Greater than
1 > 1

# Greater or equal to
1 >= 1 # Remember: ">="" and not "=>"" !

# Smaller or equal to
2 <= 1 # Remember: "<="" and not "=<"" !

# Equal
1 == 1 # Tests equality. Remember: "=="" and not "="" !

# Unequal
1 != 0 # Tests iequality

# TRUE is encoded as 1 and FALSE as 0
TRUE + 1
FALSE + 1

# In a vector-like fashion
x <- 1:5
y <- c(0, 3, 1, 5, 2)
x < y
x == y
x != y

# Subsetting of vectors
x
x[x >= 2]
x[x < 3]

# Easy way of work with parts of the data
data <- data.frame(x = c(0, 1, 3, 3, 0), y = 1:5)
data

# Data such that x is zero
data0 <- data[data$x == 0, ]
data0

# Data such that x is larger than 2
data2 <- data[data$x > 2, ]
data2

# In an example
iris$Sepal.Width[iris$Sepal.Width > 3]

# Problem - what happened?
data[x > 2, ]

# In an example
summary(iris)
summary(iris[iris$Sepal.Width > 3, ])

# On the factor variable only makes sense == and !=
summary(iris[iris$Species == "setosa", ])

# Subset argument in lm
lm(Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Length, data = iris, subset = Sepal.Width > 3)
lm(Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Length, data = iris, subset = iris$Sepal.Width > 3)
# Both iris$Sepal.Width and Sepal.Width in subset are fine: data = iris
# tells R to look for Sepal.Width in the iris dataset

# AND operator "&"
TRUE & TRUE
TRUE & FALSE
FALSE & FALSE

# OR operator "|"
TRUE | TRUE
TRUE | FALSE
FALSE | FALSE

# Both operators are useful for checking for ranges of data
y
index1 <- (y <= 3) & (y > 0)
y[index1]
index2 <- (y < 2) | (y > 4)
y[index2]

# In an example
summary(iris[iris$Sepal.Width > 3 & iris$Sepal.Width < 3.5, ])
```

```{exercise}
Do the following for the `iris` dataset:

- Compute the subset corresponding to `Petal.Length` either smaller than `1.5` or larger than `2`. Save this dataset as `irisPetal`.
- Compute and summarize a linear regression of `Sepal.Width` into `Petal.Width + Petal.Length` for the dataset `irisPetal`. What is the $R^2$? *Solution*: `0.101`.
- Check that the previous model is the same as regressing `Sepal.Width` into `Petal.Width + Petal.Length` for the dataset `iris` with the appropriate `subset` expression.
- Compute the variance for `Petal.Width` when `Petal.Width` is smaller or equal that `1.5` and larger than `0.3`. *Solution*: `0.1266541`.

```

#### Plotting functions {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, error = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# "plot" is the main function for plotting in R
# It has a different behaviour depending on the kind of object that it receives

# How to plot some data
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, main = "Sepal.Length vs Sepal.Width")

# Alrernatively
plot(iris[, 1:2], main = "Sepal.Length vs Sepal.Width")

# Change the axis limits
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0, 10))

# How to plot a curve (a parabola)
x <- seq(-1, 1, l = 50)
y <- x^2
plot(x, y)
plot(x, y, main = "A dotted parabola")
plot(x, y, main = "A parabola", type = "l")
plot(x, y, main = "A red and thick parabola", type = "l", col = "red", lwd = 3)

# Plotting a more complicated curve between -pi and pi
x <- seq(-pi, pi, l = 50)
y <- (2 + sin(10 * x)) * x^2
plot(x, y, type = "l") # Kind of rough...

# Remember that we are joining points for creating a curve!
# More detailed plot
x <- seq(-pi, pi, l = 500)
y <- (2 + sin(10 * x)) * x^2
plot(x, y, type = "l")

# For more options in the plot customization see
?plot
?par

# "plot" is a first level plotting function. That means that whenever is called,
# it creates a new plot. If we want to add information to an existing plot, we
# have to use a second level plotting function such as "points", "lines" or "abline"

plot(x, y) # Create a plot
lines(x, x^2, col = "red") # Add lines
points(x, y + 10, col = "blue") # Add points
abline(a = 5, b = 1, col = "orange", lwd = 2) # Add a straight line y = a + b * x
```

```{exercise}
Do the following:

- Plot the `faithful` dataset.
- Add the straight line $y=110-15x$ (red).
- Make a new plot for the function $y=\sin(x)$ (black). Add $y=\sin(2x)$ (red), $y=\sin(3x)$ (blue), and $y=\sin(4x)$ (orange).

```

#### Distributions {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, error = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# R allows to sample [r], compute density/probability mass functions [d],
# compute distribution function [p], and compute quantiles [q] for several
# continuous and discrete distributions. The format employed is [rdpq]name,
# where name stands for:
# - norm -> Normal
# - unif -> Uniform
# - exp -> Exponential
# - t -> Student's t
# - f -> Snedecor's F
# - chisq -> Chi squared
# - pois -> Poisson
# - binom -> Binomial
# More distributions:
?Distributions

# Sampling from a Normal - 100 random points from a N(0, 1)
rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# If you want to have always the same result, set the seed of the random number
# generator
set.seed(45678)
rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Plotting the density of a N(0, 1) - the Gauss bell
x <- seq(-4, 4, l = 100)
y <- dnorm(x = x, mean = 0, sd = 1)
plot(x, y, type = "l")

# Plotting the distribution function of a N(0, 1)
x <- seq(-4, 4, l = 100)
y <- pnorm(q = x, mean = 0, sd = 1)
plot(x, y, type = "l")

# Computing the 95% quantile for a N(0, 1)
qnorm(p = 0.95, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# All distributions have the same syntax: rname(n,...), dname(x,...), dname(p,...)  
# and qname(p,...), but the parameters in ... change. Look them in ?Distributions
# For example, here is que same for the uniform distribution

# Sampling from a U(0, 1)
set.seed(45678)
runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 1)

# Plotting the density of a U(0, 1)
x <- seq(-2, 2, l = 100)
y <- dunif(x = x, min = 0, max = 1)
plot(x, y, type = "l")

# Computing the 95% quantile for a U(0, 1)
qunif(p = 0.95, min = 0, max = 1)

# Sampling from a Bi(10, 0.5)
set.seed(45678)
samp <- rbinom(n = 200, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
table(samp) / 200

# Plotting the probability mass of a Bi(10, 0.5)
x <- 0:10
y <- dbinom(x = x, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
plot(x, y, type = "h") # Vertical bars

# Plotting the distribution function of a Bi(10, 0.5)
x <- 0:10
y <- pbinom(q = x, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
plot(x, y, type = "h")
```

```{exercise}
Do the following:

- Compute the $90\%$, $95\%$ and $99\%$ quantiles of a $F$ distribution with `df1 = 1` and `df2 = 5`. *Answer*: `c(4.060420, 6.607891, 16.258177)`.
- Plot the distribution function of a $U(0,1)$. Does it make sense with its density function?
- Sample $100$ points from a Poisson with `lambda = 5`.
- Sample $100$ points from a $U(-1,1)$ and compute its mean.
- Plot the density of a $t$ distribution with `df = 1` (use a sequence spanning from `-4` to `4`). Add lines of different colors with the densities for `df = 5`, `df = 10`, `df = 50` and `df = 100`. Do you see any pattern?

```

#### Functions {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, error = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# A function is a way of encapsulating a block of code so it can be reused easily
# They are useful for simplifying repetitive tasks and organize the analysis

# This is a silly function that takes x and y and returns its sum
# Note the use of "return" to indicate what should be returned
add <- function(x, y) {
  z <- x + y
  return(z)
}

# Calling add - you need to run the definition of the function first!
add(x = 1, y = 2)
add(1, 1) # Arguments names can be omitted

# A more complex function: computes a linear model and its posterior summary.
# Saves us a few keystrokes when computing a lm and a summary
lmSummary <- function(formula, data) {
  model <- lm(formula = formula, data = data)
  summary(model)
}
# If no return(), the function returns the value of the last expression

# Usage
lmSummary(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Width, iris)

# Recall: there is no variable called model in the workspace.
# The function works on its own workspace!
model

# Add a line to a plot
addLine <- function(x, beta0, beta1) {
  lines(x, beta0 + beta1 * x, lwd = 2, col = 2)
}

# Usage
plot(x, y)
addLine(x, beta0 = 0.1, beta1 = 0)

# The function "sapply" allows to sequentially apply a function
sapply(1:10, sqrt)
sqrt(1:10) # The same

# The advantage of "sapply" is that you can use with any function
myFun <- function(x) c(x, x^2)
sapply(1:10, myFun) # Returns a 2 x 10 matrix

# "sapply" is usefuf for plotting non-vectorized functions
sumSeries <- function(n) sum(1:n)
plot(1:10, sapply(1:10, sumSeries), type = "l")

# "apply" applies iteratively a function to rows (1) or columns (2)
# of a matrix or data frame
A <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
A
apply(A, 1, sum) # Applies the function by rows
apply(A, 2, sum) # By columns

# With other functions
apply(A, 1, sqrt)
apply(A, 2, function(x) x^2)
```

```{exercise}
Do the following:

- Create a function that takes as argument $n$ and returns the value of $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2$.
- Create a function that takes as input the argument $N$ and then plots the curve $(n, \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{i})$ for $n=1,\ldots,N$. *Hint*: use `sapply`.

```

#### Control structures {-}

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, error = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# The "for" statement allows to create loops that run along a given vector
# Prints 5 times a message (i varies in 1:5)
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}

# Another example
a <- 0
for (i in 1:3) {
  a <- i + a
}
a

# Nested loops are possible
A <- matrix(0, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
for (i in 1:2) {
  for (j in 1:3) {
    A[i, j] <- i + j
  }
}

# The "if" statement allows to create conditional structures of the forms:
# if (condition) {
#  # Something
# } else {
#  # Something else
# }
# These structures are thought to be inside functions

# Is the number positive?
isPositive <- function(x) {
  if (x > 0) {
    print("Positive")
  } else {
    print("Not positive")
  }
}

# A loop can be interrupted with the "break" statement
# Stop when x is above 100

Do the following:

- Compute $\mathbf{C}_{n\times k}$ in $\mathbf{C}_{n\times k}=\mathbf{A}_{n\times m} \mathbf{B}_{m\times k}$ from $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. Use that $c_{i,j}=\sum_{l=1}^ma_{i,l}b_{l,j}$. Test the implementation with simple examples.
- Create a function that samples a $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and returns the first sampled point that is larger than $4$.
- Create a function that simulates $N$ samples from the distribution of $\max(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ where $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are iid $\mathcal{U}(0,1)$.
