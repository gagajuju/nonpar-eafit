The following great reference books have been used extensively for preparing these notes:

- @James2013 (linear regression, logistic regression, PCA, clustering),
- @Pena2002 (linear regression, logistic regression, PCA, clustering),
- @Bartholomew2008 (PCA).

The icons used in the notes were designed by [madebyoliver](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/madebyoliver), [freepik](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik), and [roundicons](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/roundicons) from [Flaticon](http://www.flaticon.com/).
